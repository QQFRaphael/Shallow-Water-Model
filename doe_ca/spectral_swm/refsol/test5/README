Reference solutions produced by the NCAR spectral transform shallow water model (stswm).
These are for test case 5.

REF0114.cdf - T213 truncated to T106 (original solution file provided by NCAR)
REF213-213.cdf - T213 without any truncation, timestep=30s (original dt=360s)
--> all layer thickness files have been derived from this solution EXCEPT for the tweaked files,
    which were taken from the T213 w/dt=360s netcdf file (no longer available on cvs)
