issue the command "csh run_script" to compile and execute the grid
generation program. users will likely have to alter the compile
options for local platforms.

edit generate_grid.F to produce grid at different resolution.

the grids generated are those obtained by recursive bisection of the
icosahedron. the initial resursion is bisection (even grids) or
trisection (odd grids).

these grids are not been "optimized" in any manner.

in the sub-directory called "tweaked" there are 3 grids that have
been optimized using the procedure outlined in Heikes and Randall (1995b).
