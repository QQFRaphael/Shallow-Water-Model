Analysis programs - for comparing STSWM results to our shallow-water model

reftogeo.f -- sample the stswm reference solution at the specified geodesic
  grid lat/lon values. Output file is the stswm layer thicknesses sampled
  at the given geodesic grid resolution.

errnorms.f -- compute the l1, l2, and l-infinity norms.  Input the stswm 
  and geodesic swm layer thicknesses as well as the file containing the 
  geodesic grid cell areas.  

To run the this analysis program, you only need to edit the input text file.

Edit the "runit" and choose the set of compile option for your machine,
or add your machine options if your platform is not present.

Edit input and set the paths according to the instructions, then type
"runit" at the command line.
