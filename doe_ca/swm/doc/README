for folks w/ read/write access to the repository:

if you edit the swm_documentation.mif file, please export
the document as a .mif file and commit the changes. the
.mif files should be portable across all Framemaker versions.

Also, when you commit the changes, export the document to .pdf
(or save and .ps and distill it) and commit the new .pdf file
to the repository. This insures that users w/o access to 
Framemaker can read the documentation.
